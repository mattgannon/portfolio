    <div class="about">
        <p>Recent graduate of Columbia College Chicago with a Bachelor of Arts in Graphic Design. I communicate using visuals that can be applied to print and web applications. I earned an Associate in Applied Science - Graphics Arts Technology: Web Design from Harper College, where I was involved with the Graphic Arts Design Club. Currently I'm a Graphic Design Intern at @properties in Chicago, IL.</p>

        <p>In my free time I enjoy playing disc golf at local courses. If I'm indoors then you'll probably find me playing video games on my computer. My current goals: shoot product photography and learn Blender.</p>
