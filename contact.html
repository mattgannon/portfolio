    <div class="about">
        <p>Currently I'm a student at Columbia College Chicago learning both graphic and web design. I create graphics using visuals that can be applied to print, digital, and/or web applications. I earned an Associate in Applied Science - Graphics Arts Technology: Web Design from Harper College, and will complete my Bachelor of Arts in Graphic Design this Fall 2019.</p>

        <p>In my free time I enjoy playing disc golf at local courses. If I'm indoors then you'll probably find me playing video games on my computer. My current summer objectives: shoot product photography, start learning guitar, and practice Tekken 7.</p>
