    <div class="about">
        <p>Currently I'm a student at Columbia College Chicago learning both graphic and web design. I create graphics using visuals that can be applied to print, digital, and/or web applications.</p>

        <p>In my free time I enjoy playing disc golf at local courses. If I'm indoors then you'll probably find me playing video games on my computer. My current summer objectives: shoot product photography, start learning guitar, and practice Tekken 7.</p>

        <p>Take a look at my <a class="mail" href="">resume</a>.</p>

        <p>And you can reach me at <a class="mail" href="mailto:mattgannon.design@gmail.com">mattgannon.design@gmail.com</a>.</p>
